# Memory Game

## Description

This Memory Game is a fun and engaging way to test your memory skills. The game consists of a grid of cards, each with a symbol on one side. The cards are laid out face down, and players flip two cards over each turn to find matching pairs. The objective is to remember the locations of previously seen symbols and match all pairs in the fewest moves possible. The highscore is stored in localstorage.

4. **Scoring**: The game tracks the number of moves you make. Try to match all pairs in the fewest moves to achieve a high score. Your best score is saved as the "Highscore".
